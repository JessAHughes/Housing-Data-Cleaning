# Housing Market Data Cleaning

## Project Overview 

In this project I used SQL to clean up a dataset of the housing market in Nashville, TN. It was a bit of a mess, so this would help immensely to do any exploratory data analysis. 

### Tools

- Excel - Data Familiarization
- MySQL - Data cleaning

### Data Cleaning Steps

These are some of the steps I took to clean up the data: 
1. Deleted unused/duplicated columns
2. Unified selling information
3. Seperated addresses into multiple columns, ie. "Street", "City", and "State"
4. Reformatted the dates to be easier to use
